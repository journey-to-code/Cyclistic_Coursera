clistic Bike-Share Case Study
This repository contains the code and write-up for a data analysis case study exploring how a fictional bike-share company, Cyclistic, can attract more riders. The study follows the data analysis process, outlined in the steps below:

1. Ask: Identify the business question and key stakeholders.

2. Prepare: Download, organize, and clean relevant data.

3. Process: Analyze the data to identify trends and relationships.

4. Analyze: Summarize the findings and create visualizations.

5. Share: Communicate the insights to stakeholders effectively.

6. Act: Develop recommendations based on the analysis.

This case study is designed to showcase the skills and tasks undertaken by a junior data analyst, aiming to:

Demonstrate proficiency in data analysis: Downloading, cleaning, manipulating, and analyzing data.
Highlight communication skills: Effectively presenting findings through visualizations and reports.
Showcase problem-solving abilities: Identifying trends and drawing conclusions to inform decision-making.
This project utilizes publicly available bicycle trip data to answer the question: "How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?"

The outcome is a comprehensive report outlining the analysis, key findings, and actionable recommendations for Cyclistic's marketing team. This report can be used to inform future marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.
